--- Fishing Information --
Fishing related commands ONLY works in fishing activated channels (ask your guild admin)
Summary commands are $cast $bucket $fishoff $tacklebox $fishbase
The fishing game is cross-server so your will be competing with all other servers woodhouse is in.

$cast throws your line and you have a certain % chance to get something, there is a 1 minute spam cooldown.
If you fish every minute your chances of catching something will be extremly low, waiting around an hour
gives the fisher the average success chance, waiting longer (up to a certain point) yields better chances.

Every fish has a range of weight it can be, to make it more fun instead of just numbers your catches range of weight
is displayed in the prefix of the name (tiny-small-medium-large-big-huge) to give you atleast an idea.
Some fishes are rarer than others (has nothing to do with weight) and the rarity of the fish is displayed by the
outline of the portrait (green-blue-yellow-orange-red)

Every fish gives your profile XP, your profile can be viewed along with your currently held top 10 fish with the
$bucket command.
As you increase in level your chances of failure will decrease in small increments.

When you get a duplicate of a fish you already have the smaller one will get sold and yield you Bells a.k.a money.
Bells will also be earned from other sources including catching unique/shiny fish, and winning the competition.
(Beware that bells as of this writing still has no real use , but it will be in future updates)

$fishoff command will list the leaderboard for the current season each fisher will have their biggest fish listed.
The season ends at midnight on the turn off the month Woodhouse localtime (CEST), consult the $whoami command to see
the server localtime.
The winner will be rewarded price bells and also immortalized in a winner scoreboard(not displayable atm), and all
fishers will have their buckets emptied of fish and it starts over again.

$fishbase <name of the fish> will give list the encylopedia entry for that fish and also give the current world
record and also list what fishers currently have that fish in their bucket along with some other information.

Each class of fish (there are 7) has 1-2 Unique fish that yields a bigger xp/bells reward when caught, some of them
can be quite large but some of the can also be quite small considering the classes etc.
Each unique fish can ONLY be caught ONCE per season by any fisher.

Shinies, there is a small chance (1% or less) that any fish can result in a shiny version.
A shiny rewards the catcher instantly with bells price, and a shiny have the potential of being a much larger version
of its normal counterpart , it should be noted that even if a fish is shiny it can still be a "TINY" (i.e
in the lower weight spectrum of its kind) however getting a "HUGE" shiny will almost certainly yield a world record fish.
